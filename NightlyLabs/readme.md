Read Me Please
==================

I decided to open source the nightlylabs website. It still has a few bugs. And I am curious if anyone will look through the code after interacting with www.nightlylabs.com. Any bug fixed you commit would be greatly appreciated. Feel free to utilize our software but please don't pirate our designs for commercial purposes.
