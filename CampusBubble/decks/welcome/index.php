With your help, this year’s campus events will be like never before. Every day, awesome guest lecturers come to Emory. Every day, a student organization is doing something awesome. Every day, friends talk about their classes, student groups have fun together, faculty discover something new. We have fun and grow close together on the weekends. We know about so little of it. As a result, our community isn’t as strong as it could be.

Because we are in the bubble, we get into our routine and slowly get out of sync with the bigger community. I invite you to join a new kind of bubble...


Because even if you’re too busy the night of to go, you’ll be part of the community. You’ll look through the video, the photos, the tweets, the comments off the event if you were curious about it.

So if you’re doing something great. Please tell me about it. 

When I was a freshman, I thought about 

With College Seniors, Pat Shea and Ian McCall, myself and fellow junior, Giovanni Hobbins, we are making this dream a reality. We are excited to work very closely with the university organizations that you are a part of.
